# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## **Info of the project**

> The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
>
> You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
>
> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
> 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to run

Open `run_analysis.r` script in RStudio and change the parameter of the setwd function call to the directory with the `UCI HAR Dataset` inside.

Run the script.
 
Check for `tidy dataset.txt` file in the working directory.
